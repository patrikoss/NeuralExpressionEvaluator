# Symbol detection

This is an attempt to create a symbol detector. In our approach we use two methods for accomplishing the task:
- one, which we call opencv, which is based on image manipulation
- sliding window, in which we train the detector end-to-end.

Refer to the report.pdf file enclosed in the repository to read about our findings.
